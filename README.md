### 1000‑Hour Mastery Plan for Full‑Stack Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP & Time Series
## Overview and Philosophy
This 1 000‑hour roadmap is designed to take a motivated learner from foundational mathematics to state‑of‑the‑art research in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP) and time‑series forecasting. The plan emphasises balanced study and practice: roughly half of the time is spent understanding theory and half is spent implementing algorithms, writing code, solving problems and completing projects. It also encourages following leading educators like Andrew Ng, Andrej Karpathy, and Krish Naik, who have created high‑quality courses and content that lower barriers to entry.
